This project is an analysis of the average movie durations on Netflix from 2011-2020. We use Python and its libraries, Pandas and Matplotlib, to manipulate and visualize the data.

## Getting Started
In order to run this project, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed: Pandas, Matplotlib. You can install these libraries using pip by running the following commands:

`pip install pandas`

`pip install matplotlib`

## Data
The data for this project is provided in a CSV file, "datasets/netflix_data.csv". This file contains information about the show_id, type, title, director, country, date_added, release_year, and duration of each Netflix movie from 2011-2020.

## Code
The code for this project is provided in the file "netflix_durations.py". This script performs the following tasks:
1. Loading the data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame
2. Creating a line plot of the average movie durations over time
3. Printing the first five rows of the DataFrame for inspection

# Running the Code
To run the code, navigate to the directory where the project files are located and run the following command:

`python netflix_durations.py`

This will execute the script and generate a line plot of the average movie durations over time. The plot will be displayed in a new window and the first five rows of the DataFrame will be printed in the console.

# Conclusion
The project shows that the average movie durations on Netflix have been decreasing over the past ten years. The generated line plot makes it easy to spot this trend. With the full dataset and the knowledge of python, one can perform further explorations and answer questions such as what does this trend look like over a longer period of time, and is this trend explainable by something like the genre of entertainment?

# Contribution
If you have any suggestion or would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to fork the repository and make the necessary changes.
